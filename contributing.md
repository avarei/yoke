# Contributing to Yoke

Welcome to Yoke! This document is a guideline about how to contribute to Yoke.
If you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.

## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).

## Contributing

The Yoke project is proud to be an OpenSource project and welcomes participation and contributions from the community via github's issue tracker and/or pull requests.

### GitHub workflow

To create a pull request:
- fork the repository
- open a pull request against `main`

Commit messages should be meaningful as they will end up in the changelog.

Please use the format: `<component or package affected>: message`.

Messages containing the string `breaking change` will trigger a minor version bump.

Minor version bumps are used to signal breaking changed until the project reaches v1.0.0 at which point semantic versioning will be used proper.

### Open an issue / PR

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yokecd/yoke/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/yokecd/yoke/pulls) for trackers.

If you find a typo in document, find a bug in code, or want new features, or want to give suggestions,
you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/yokecd/yoke/issues/new) to report it.
Please follow the guideline message in the issue template.

If you want to contribute, please follow the [contribution workflow](#github-workflow) and create a new pull request.
If your PR contains large changes, e.g. component refactor or new components, please write detailed documents
about its design and usage.

Note that a single PR should not be too large. If heavy changes are required, it's better to separate the changes
to a few individual PRs.

### Code review

All code should be well reviewed by one or more committers. 

## Community

N/A. Will be updated once we have a slack channel or discord setup.

### Contact us

Contact the maintainers via the issue tracker.
